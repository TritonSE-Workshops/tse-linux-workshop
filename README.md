This guide will walk you through how to take a barebones Arch Linux installation
and customize it to your liking. It'll also go over a bit of kernel compilation.

## VirtualBox Setup

## Logging In

The login credentials are listed below:

* Username: tse
* Password: .

Note that the password is literally just a period. This should
make it to switch to superuser access. I would not recommend that sort of
password for a regular machine however.

After you login, you should be greeted with a bash shell. Type in

```
echo $SHELL
```

It should print "/bin/bash". Try `$XDG_SESSION_TYPE` too; it should be "tty".
